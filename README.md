In this project, I attempt to build accurate ML models for forecasting oil spill frequencies and intensities using historical data from the study area. It follows the usual data science model building flow - scrapping the data off the government sites, data cleaning, EDA, data profiling, feature engineering, auto ml, model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, model analysis, prediction.
